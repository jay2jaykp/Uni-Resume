**Title:** Selecting and Evaluating Data Repositories and Mobile Survey Tools to Solve the Challenge of Long-term SMART Nutritional Survey Data Preservation and Accessibility

**Link:** _comming soon_

**Abstract:** Long-term preservation and accessibility of digital assets is an essential part of any organization that involves data-driven decision making. Such organizations must have an infrastructure to ensure sustainability and reliability of the data. Action Against Hunger (ACF), the project convener for the SMART survey initiative, wants a solution for the data accessibility and storage challenges arose due to paper-based survey method which leads to under-utilization and duplication of efforts. This project explores the domain of data repository, aiming to find a data repository framework that best satisfies the needs of SMART. As a part of evaluating criteria, the project explores the Data Management Planning (DMP) and prepares a questionnaire for the client (ACF) to get more insight into the requirements. Finally, the project concludes with the working instances of two data repository frameworks: DSpace and Dataverse, as well as an instance of a Mobile Survey Tool: ODK. The project demonstrates the data flow from Mobile Survey Tool to Data Repository using IPython notebook.

**Title:** Towards a ML based Cache Management Policy

**Link:** _comming soon_

**Abstract:** Enterprise data centers store persistent data in different storage media, varying in speed and capacity.Reducing overall latency incurred in serving requests involves migrating frequently accessed hotdata from slower to faster media (fetching) and moving colder data from faster to slower media(eviction).  Managing data involves conventional, hard-coded algorithms that either do not reflectthe access patterns of enterprise workloads (LRU, LFU, FIFO) or are practically unimplementable(OPT). In this paper, we analyze real-world workload traces and evaluate 3 machine learning basedapproaches - Logistic Regression, Neural Network and k-NN for block eviction over hybrid media.Second, we propose two novel hyper parameters - sampling_frequency and evict count for cachereplacement policy. Third, we architect two data models - Block Cache and Vectorized Cache forblock classification.  Finally, our proposed block eviction technique is scalable across cache sizes when a parametric Machine Learning algorithm is used.
