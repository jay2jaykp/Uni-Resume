### Course Projects

#### [1] Big-Data Analytics Project
 - Title: “Co-following on GitHub”
 - Link: https://github.com/jay2jaykp/Co-Following-on-GitHub 
 - Summary:
    - Re-produced the methodology published in the paper “Co-following on Twitter”, finding similarity between twitter users having mutual followers but on GitHub rather than Twitter
    - Used Apache Spark distributed cluster-computing framework with Python to reproduce the code enabling large-scale parallel data processing
  
#### [2] Data Mining and Analysis on Social Media
 - Title: “Canada’s Image on Syrian Crisis: Sentiment Analysis”
